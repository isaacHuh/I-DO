# I-DO
Descriptions:

I-DO is a CST 205 group project created in Fall 2018. It was developed by Isaac Torres, Oscar Ruiz, and Daniel Miguel. I-DO is a chatbot that can start a game, a beat, a conversation, and send a tweet when asked. We came up with this idea by just brainstorming and just spewing random ideas and then somehow we came up with the idea of making a multipurpose chatbot. Our group split up the project into three parts: chatbot, beat, and game. After we finished all 3 parts, one of us put it together and made it work perfectly.

What you need to install:

Chatterbot, Twitter API, Pyglet, Tkinter, Numpy, and Pyaudio

Instructions:

To run our chatbot simply clone our repo to your computer, using your terminal access the folder where you saved the repo, and run "chatbot.py". The GUI will pop up with a response button and a text box; in the textbox type whatever you want, but if you want to run the game type play game, if you want to play a beat type play beat. To stop the game, press your esc key. We will put screenshots to make it clearer.
